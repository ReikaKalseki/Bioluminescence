[mod-setting-description]
tree-refresh-rate=When the mod profile of a save file is changed, the world will be scanned for biolum entities to replace any missing lights and remove straggling entities. This is the number of chunks scanned per tick. Higher numbers complete the scan more quickly, but reduce UPS more severely while it is ongoing, while lower ones reduce its impact but lengthen its duration. Set it to zero to disable this resynchronization, but be warned that doing so will likely result in missing or leftover lights accumulating in older saves.
script-lights=Whether the lights on the plants use the LuaRendering mod scripting system for adding lights. This is cleaner and more reliable, but is markedly worse for client framerate performance on large maps. If this option is false, the lights will be accomplished with hidden entities instead, which does not have the FPS impact, but is messier and may cause weird issues like lights persisting after their plant is removed via unexpected means.
